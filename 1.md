#1. “The world is all there is.”

Let's define all this through the abstract collection Collection

Here, the interpretation of the reading can be in two versions
## Option 1 
public class World implements IsTheCase

## Option 2
public class world {
    Collection<IsTheCase> everething;
}

## Justification of choice
 I chose option 2, since in the first case the interpretation of what was written would sound like this:
 “The world is what it is,” which doesn't fully reflect the phrase. Wittgenstein clearly shows the aggregation in the statement
 and it is not explicitly said that there is a world and that there is a world.
 
 ## Java
 Collection - corresponds to the language "all that", followed by specifying all that in parentheses.
 
 # 1.1 The world is a collection of facts, not objects.
 # 1.11 The world is defined by the facts and by the fact that they are all facts.
 Here, in my opinion, are unnecessary explanations: 
 - the fact is not an object, 
 - if there is peace use in the meaning of "there is".
 
 # 1.12 Because the totality of all facts determines both everything that takes place and everything that does not.
 One interface of Caseable and its extensions is suggested here, but Yaano V. does not talk about this, so he introduced two interfaces.
 
 # 1.13 Facts in logical space are the world.
 Adding the logic package, but this is superfluous, since even before the introduction of space we have this fact.
 
 #1.2 The world is falling apart into facts.
 If the world is determined by facts, then, accordingly, it consists of facts. Here, in my opinion, there is a tautology on the face.
 
 # 1.21 Any fact may or may not occur, and everything else remains the same.
 Here L.V. comes to the conclusion that the previously introduced division of concepts into "takes place" and "does not take place" is a property of the fact.
 This in turn drives refactoring, takes place. "The presence of this fact already in the first paragraph suggests that this treatise is a living chain of conclusions and refactoring one 
 from inference techniques, be it LPT or programming. What I noticed in 1.12 LV decided to detail and substantiate the fact that is quite obvious at the moment in 1.21.

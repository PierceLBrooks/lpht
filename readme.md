Project Objective
============
Check the logic of the logical and philosophical treatise for consistency.

Tasks
======
1. Build an object-oriented model of the LPT (Logical-Philosophical Treatise)
2. In case of contradictions, change the understanding of the reading and at this point move to a new branch

Basic principles of construction
============================
1. Each item is numbered under its own index
2. In the event of a conflict, it is necessary to look at all options for possible reading of the current item and the version of the item with which the conflict arises
3. Make branches of possible reading - a reserve for the future to expand the model with possible worlds and further analysis
4. Commit to produce only the compiled code, write the content of the item in the comment.
5. Entities are named after Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus II
6. Comments ===========
At the time L. Wittgenstein wrote the LFT, there was no programming language, it was impossible to write code and check for consistency with the compiler. 
Validation was carried out in the mind, using a thought experiment. Errors are possible with this approach.
There may also be flaws in the Java language in terms of logic, which can also be checked and, in case of insufficiency, reasonably substantiate the need
and come up with a proposal to add the missing structure to the specification.
